SYNOPSIS

      # see Device::RFXCOM::RX (and corresponding example script
      # rfxcom-rx) and see Device::RFXCOM::TX (and example script
      # rfxcom-tx)

DESCRIPTION

    Modules to support RF receivers and transmitters produced by RFXCOM,
    http://www.rfxcom.com/. This code is derived from code written for the
    xPL-Perl project at http://www.xpl-perl.org.uk/.

    A bonus module is provided to support W800 RF receivers from
    http://www.wgldesigns.com/. These receivers recognize fewer RF
    protocols.

    These devices are typically used for home automation and sensor
    monitoring applications.

THANKS

    Special thanks to RFXCOM, http://www.rfxcom.com/, for their excellent
    documentation and for giving me permission to use it to help me write
    this code. I own a number of their products and highly recommend them.
