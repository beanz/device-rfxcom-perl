=head1 NAME

rfxcom-rx - simple example script to read from an RFXCOM receiver

=head1 VERSION

version 1.163170

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # read from USB tty device
  rfxcom-rx /dev/ttyUSB0

  # read from USB device with nicer name see Device::RFXCOM::RX(3)
  rfxcom-rx /dev/rfxcom-rx

  # read from network/wireless device
  rfxcom-rx 10.0.0.1:10001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an example of the usage of the L<Device::RFXCOM::RX>
API.  It simply initializes the receiver and writes a summary of the
received RF messages to stdout.  The keys and values given on the
command line become the parameter hash for the L<Device::RFXCOM::RX>
constructor and are documented in that module.

=head1 THANKS

Special thanks to RFXCOM, L<http://www.rfxcom.com/>, for their
excellent documentation and for giving me permission to use it to help
me write this code.  I own a number of their products and highly
recommend them.
